# TerminallyChatting

A terminal-based chat application written in Python. I remember having this idea years ago back in middle school but I randomly had a dream reminding me about it as an undergraduate.

-Socket programming, threading
-TCP/IP client-server communication
-Concurrency handling
-Terminal interface design

## Features

- Real-time chat between multiple clients through a server using TCP sockets
- Username support
- Simple and colorful Terminal UI
