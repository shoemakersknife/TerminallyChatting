# TerminallyChatting

A terminal-based chat application written in Python. I remember having this idea years ago back in middle school but I randomly had a dream reminding me about it as an undergraduate. Making this project required gaining knowledge of some networking fundamentals.

-Socket programming, threading

-TCP/IP client-server communication

-Concurrency handling

-Terminal interface design

## Features

- Real-time chat between multiple clients through a server using TCP sockets
