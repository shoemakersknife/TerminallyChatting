# TerminallyChatting

A terminal-based chat application written in Python. I remember having this idea years ago back in middle school but I forgot about it. Not completely though, cause years later I dreamt of it as an undergraduate. Making this project required gaining knowledge of some networking fundamentals.

Currently finding a way to connect clients without knowledge of each other's IP addresses.

-Socket programming, threading

-TCP/IP client-server communication

-Concurrency handling

-Terminal interface design

## Features

- Real-time chat between multiple clients through a server using TCP sockets

- Username support

- Simple and colorful Terminal UI
